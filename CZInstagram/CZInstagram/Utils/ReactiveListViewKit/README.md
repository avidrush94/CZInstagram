# ReactiveListViewKit

MVVM + FLUX reactive facade ViewKit for feed based app development. Eliminates Massive View Controller in unidirectional Event/State flow manner.

#### MVVM + FLUX
#### Massive View Controller Terminator
 * No more UICollectionViewDataSource/UICollectionViewDelegate overhead
 * No more long if statement to manage model/cell mapping, event handling
 * No more delegation - event driven, loosely coupled pattern
 * FLUX one way data flow solves core problems of MVC: 
   * Central Mediator
   * Event Propagration
   * Data Binding

#### FeedList/FeedDetails Facade View Class wrapping complex UICollectionView
 * Implement Instagram feedList within 50 lines of code
 * Embedded `HorizontalSectionAdapterView` makes nested horizontal ListView implementation within 10 lines of code
 * Adaptive to various CellComponent classes:
   * UICollectionViewCell
   * UIView
   * UIViewController - Domained event handling for complex cell
 * Embedded pagination events 
   * `CZFeedListViewEvent` - `pullToRefresh`/`loadMore`

 
#### Unidirectional Data Flow
 * **Dispatcher:** Propagates domained events

 * **Store:** Maintains the State tree

 * **Subscriber:** Subscribes to Store and update Components/Views with new State

 * **Event:** Event driven - more loosely coupled than Delegation
    
 * **State:**
   * Waterfall reacting flow
   * Composition: RootState is composited by subStates
   * React(to:) Event and outputs new State, propagates Event to its children substate nodes

#### Automatic Batch Update
  * UICollectionView CellState diff algorithm on top of Longest Common Subsequence
  * Perform Insert/Delete/Move sections/cells based on internal models diff algorithm

#### Declarative/Immutable/Predictable
  * Efficient ViewModel tree diff algorithm on top of Longest Common Subsequence
