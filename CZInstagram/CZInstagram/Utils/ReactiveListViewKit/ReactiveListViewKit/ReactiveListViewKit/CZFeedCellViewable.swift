///        - In CZFeedListFacadeView:
///           - if CZFeedCellViewable is Cell, it will be dequeued to reuse. Recommended if there're more than one type of Cell involved for reusable performance.
///           - if CZFeedCellViewable is UIView, it will be automatically added/overlapped to embeded Cell. Recommended if there's only one type of Cell involved.
///           - if CZFeedCellViewable is UIViewController, its `didMove(to:)` parentViewController method will be invoked and its `view` will be automatically added/overlapped to embeded Cell
///
///        - In CZFeedDetailsFacadeView:
///           - if CZFeedCellViewable is UIView, it will be appended to underlying UIStackView
///           - if CZFeedCellViewable is UIViewController, its view will be ppended to underlying UIStackView, and itself will be moved(toParentVC:) with containerViewController
